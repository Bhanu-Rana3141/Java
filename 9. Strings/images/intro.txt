- What strings 
- Why strings
- Data type 
- Interning -> string pool -> saving memory 
- new -> allocating new memory
- immutability 

- memory allocation -> Java stores the reference to the string object, and the actual string is stored in String Pool part of heap memory.

- == & str.equals()
== -> compare references
str.equals() -> first checks address and then compares values

- strings does not have null character at last but internally they are stored as char array


*** STRING BUILDER ***
- Class, is a mutable sequence of characters used to perform manipulations in strings like appending another string, inserting , deleting without creating a new string
- Efficient than strings
- after performing operations converted back to string using (sb.toString(str)) , although sb is implicitly converted into string but for more clarity we use this method
- default capacity of string builder is to hold 16 characters and it changes dynamically if the size of string builder increses
